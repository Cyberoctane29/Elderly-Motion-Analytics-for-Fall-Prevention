# Fall-Prevention-and-Elderly-Motion-Classifier
 This project implements binomial logistic regression in Python to predict whether an individual is lying down based on vertical acceleration data. Designed for healthcare and fall detection applications, the model helps identify patterns in motion that correlate with lying downâ€”a critical factor in elderly care and injury prevention.
